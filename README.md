# Wordle Clone in React.js

## Description
Partner project with my classmate [Leah Perri](https://github.com/perrileah) where we created a clone of the popular game Wordle using React.js
- Created 5 different component functions, 1 custom hook and a json file of words and letters. 
- Functionality includes storing an array of past guesses (each past guess is an array of letter objects, and each object represents a letter in the guess word {letter: 'a', color: 'yellow'}). We also built functionality to color-code each guess letter in both the grid and keypad.
- Added custom css including keyframe animations to mimic the actual Wordle game
- Created modal for the end of the game

### Roadmap
- Functionality for sharing on social media 
- Instead of json file of words, integrate a backend API of words
- Limitation that only allows the user to play the game once a day if desired
- Make a themed Wordle for something different and fun!
